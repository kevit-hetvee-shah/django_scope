     - A single paragraph summarizing the overall requirements (what the project must deliver).  
     - Followed by a list of bullet points, each stating one specific requirement.
  2. `## Project Understanding`  
     - A single paragraph (2–3 sentences) summarizing why the project exists, its core goals, and context.  
     - Followed by a list of bullet points highlighting key aspects of that understanding.
  3. `## Project Scope`
     - A high level project scope.

  - Keep language **outcome-focused** and **concise**.
- **Conciseness**:
  - Paragraphs: **Requirements** – one paragraph; **Understanding** – no more than three sentences.

- **Feedback & Revision**:
  - If feedback is provided, **revise both sections in one pass**, integrating all suggestions without reintroducing excluded details.
