# Project Requirements for AI-Driven Market Trend Prediction and Grease Trap Recycling Optimization

## Problem Statement
Envirol currently lacks an advanced AI-driven system to accurately predict market size, grease collection volumes, and outlet-specific behaviors. This gap leads to inefficiencies in scheduling, route optimization, and detection of unauthorized waste disposal, resulting in suboptimal recycling operations and missed opportunities for environmental impact reduction.

## Stakeholder Needs
- Predictive insights to identify restaurants likely to miss grease trap cleanings in the current and following month.
- Dynamic scoring and grading of each establishment to prioritize and tailor service actions.
- Forecasting of grease waste volumes for better resource allocation and operational planning.
- Smart scheduling capabilities to optimize inspector routes and workloads.
- Early detection of illegal grease trap waste dumping to mitigate environmental risks.
- Analysis and reporting of revenue fluctuations with explanatory insights for strategic decision-making.
- Assessment tools to measure environmental impact improvements through proper waste disposal.
- Methods to identify and flag non-legal cleaning activities to ensure regulatory compliance.
- User-friendly dashboard presenting actionable insights accessible to operational managers and decision-makers.
- Integration with 15+ years of historical plant data and potential external data sources for comprehensive analysis.

## Project Requirements
- Develop an AI model capable of predicting which restaurants will miss their scheduled grease trap cleaning in the current and next month.
- Implement a dynamic scoring system that assigns grades to each establishment based on historical and real-time data.
- Enable forecasting of future grease waste collection volumes to support proactive planning.
- Create smart scheduling algorithms that optimize inspector routes and schedules to improve operational efficiency.
- Build detection mechanisms to identify potential illegal dumping activities in deserts, valleys, and trash cans.
- Incorporate analytical capabilities to identify and explain fluctuations in revenue attributed to operational or market changes.
- Provide tools to assess and report the reduction in environmental impact resulting from improved proper dumping practices.
- Design features for identifying non-legal cleaning activities to help enforce compliance and reduce unauthorized operations.
- Develop a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that consolidates predictive insights and key metrics for ease of use by stakeholders.
- Ensure the system leverages Envirol’s extensive historical data and integrates relevant external data sources to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Constraints & Assumptions
- The project relies on the availability and quality of 15+ years of historical plant data.
- External data sources may have variable accessibility and quality, which could impact model performance.
- Budget and timeline constraints require prioritization of primary objectives before secondary features.
- The system must comply with relevant environmental regulations and data privacy laws.
- Assumes consistent data update frequency to maintain prediction accuracy and scheduling relevance.
- Integration with existing operational workflows and data systems at Envirol is feasible within project scope.

## Success Metrics
- Accuracy rate of predictions identifying restaurants missing scheduled cleanings (target >85%).
- Improvement in route and schedule efficiency measured by reduced inspector travel time and increased coverage.
- Increase in detected illegal dumping cases compared to historical baseline.
- Quantifiable reduction in environmental impact indicators linked to proper grease trap waste disposal.
