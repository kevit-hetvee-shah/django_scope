# Project Requirements for AI-Driven Market Trend Prediction and Grease Trap Recycling Optimization

## Project Understanding  
Envirol seeks to develop an AI system leveraging over 15 years of proprietary plant data combined with specific external data sources—such as local market size reports, regional weather data, and waste management statistics—to enhance grease trap recycling operations. These external sources will enrich the AI models by providing broader contextual insights, improving prediction accuracy regarding market size, grease collection volumes, and environmental factors affecting grease trap maintenance.  

The system aims to improve operational efficiency, environmental compliance, and strategic decision-making by delivering predictive insights and optimized workflows tailored to distinct stakeholder roles:  
- **Administrators:** Oversee system configuration, data governance, and high-level operational strategy.  
- **Inspectors:** Utilize optimized schedules and routes to conduct inspections and report compliance or irregularities.  
- **Data Analysts:** Validate AI outputs, identify emerging trends, and support continuous model refinement.  
- **Operations Managers:** Leverage forecasts and insights to optimize collection logistics, resource allocation, and monitor compliance.  

The solution will provide an intuitive, role-based dashboard accessible across devices, enabling users to interact efficiently with key insights, alerts, and operational data. Continuous data integration and user feedback mechanisms will support ongoing accuracy improvements and user experience enhancements.

## Problem Statement  
Envirol currently lacks an integrated, AI-driven platform capable of accurately predicting which restaurants will miss grease trap cleanings, resulting in inefficient scheduling, suboptimal resource allocation, environmental risks, and difficulty detecting illegal dumping or revenue anomalies. Existing manual processes limit proactive operational interventions and strategic planning. There is a critical need for a data-driven solution that provides actionable predictive insights, optimizes field operations, and strengthens environmental compliance monitoring.

## Stakeholder Needs  
- Accurate and timely prediction of restaurants likely to miss scheduled grease trap cleanings in the current and following month, enabling proactive intervention.  
- A dynamic and transparent scoring system assigning grades to establishments based on cleaning adherence and risk levels to prioritize inspections and resource deployment.  
- Reliable forecasts of grease waste collection volumes for upcoming months to support logistics and capacity planning.  
- Efficient, optimized inspection and collection schedules and routing plans that reduce travel time and operational costs.  
- Early detection and alerting capabilities for potential illegal grease waste dumping in unauthorized locations such as deserts, valleys, and trash receptacles to maintain environmental compliance.  
- Analytical insights explaining fluctuations in revenue streams, supporting informed operational and financial decision-making.  
- Reporting on environmental impact improvements attributable to increased compliance with proper grease trap waste disposal.  
- Identification and monitoring of non-legal grease trap cleanings to uphold service integrity and regulatory standards.  
- An intuitive, secure, role-based dashboard tailored to the needs of each stakeholder group, presenting predictive insights, alerts, schedules, and detailed reports.  
- Seamless integration of Envirol’s historical plant data with external data sources (market size reports, weather data, waste management statistics) to enhance predictive model robustness and contextual accuracy.  
- Compliance with applicable data privacy, security, and regulatory standards to safeguard sensitive operational data.  
- Comprehensive training programs and ongoing stakeholder engagement to ensure effective system adoption and sustained utilization.  
- Clearly defined project phases with measurable deliverables and timelines to manage expectations and track progress.  
- A structured feedback loop enabling end-users to provide continuous input for iterative improvement of AI model performance and system usability.

## Project Requirements  

**Primary Objectives:**  
- Develop predictive models that identify restaurants at risk of missing grease trap cleanings during the current and next month with a defined accuracy metric (e.g., minimum 85% precision).  
- Implement a dynamic grading and scoring system for establishments reflecting cleaning adherence and risk, enabling prioritized inspections and efficient resource allocation.

**Secondary Objectives:**  
- Forecast grease waste collection volumes for future months to inform operational and logistical planning.  
- Generate optimized inspection and collection schedules and routing plans to maximize field efficiency and reduce costs.  
- Detect and flag potential illegal grease waste dumping incidents in unauthorized locations such as deserts, valleys, and trash receptacles.  
- Analyze revenue fluctuations, identify root causes, and provide actionable insights for strategic operational adjustments.  
- Assess and report environmental impact improvements resulting from increased compliance with proper grease trap waste disposal methods.  
- Develop methodologies to identify and monitor non-legal grease trap cleanings to maintain service and regulatory standards.

**Dashboard & Integration Requirements:**  
- Provide an intuitive, secure, and role-based dashboard accessible via web and mobile devices, customized for administrators, inspectors, data analysts, and operations managers.  
- Present predictive insights, alerts, operational schedules, analytical reports, and compliance monitoring data clearly and accessibly.  
- Integrate Envirol’s historical plant data with selected external data sources (market size reports from industry databases, regional weather information from meteorological services, waste management statistics from government agencies) ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and timely updates.  
- Establish continuous data ingestion and integration pipelines to support model retraining and accuracy improvements.  
- Ensure strict adherence to data privacy, security, and regulatory policies relevant to operational and personal data.

## Constraints & Assumptions  
- Predictive model accuracy depends on the quality, completeness, and recency of Envirol’s historical data and availability of reliable external data sources.  
- Access to and integration of external data sources may be subject to licensing, availability, and compliance restrictions, potentially impacting model scope and precision.  
- Primary objectives (missed cleaning prediction and dynamic scoring) will be prioritized for initial delivery; secondary objectives will be developed in subsequent phases based on project resources and timelines.  
- The solution must comply with all applicable data privacy, security, and regulatory standards throughout development and deployment.  
- Successful adoption relies on effective stakeholder training, clear communication, and ongoing engagement to ensure alignment with operational needs.  
- User roles and access rights will be defined in accordance with Envirol’s governance policies to safeguard data and system integrity.  
- Continuous end-user feedback will be systematically collected to inform iterative system improvements and ensure relevance.

## Success Metrics
