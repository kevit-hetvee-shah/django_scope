# Project Requirements for AI-Based Market Trend Prediction and Optimization of Grease Trap Recycling Operations

## Problem Statement
Envirol currently lacks an advanced predictive system to accurately forecast market size, grease collection volumes, and operational inefficiencies, resulting in suboptimal routing, scheduling, and potential undetected illegal dumping. This limits the company's ability to optimize recycling operations, improve market understanding, and enhance environmental impact through proper grease waste management.

## Project Purpose and Objectives
The project is being built to leverage over 15 years of plant data along with possible external data sources to develop an AI system that predicts market trends and optimizes grease trap recycling operations. It aims to increase operational efficiency, reduce missed cleanings, improve scheduling, detect illegal activities, and provide actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard. This will enable Envirol to enhance revenue management and environmental compliance.

## Stakeholder Needs
- **Accurate Prediction:** Ability to predict which restaurants will miss grease trap cleaning in the current and upcoming month to minimize missed services and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Dynamic Scoring:** Implement a dynamic grading system for each establishment based on historical and real-time data to prioritize service delivery.
- **Volume Forecasting:** Forecast future grease waste collection volumes to aid in resource planning and operational scaling.
- **Scheduling Optimization:** Generate intelligent schedules for inspectors to maximize coverage efficiency and reduce operational costs.
- **Illegal Dumping Detection:** Identify potential illegal grease waste dumping in sensitive locations such as deserts, valleys, and trash cans to ensure regulatory compliance.
- **Revenue Analysis:** Analyze revenue fluctuations with detailed causative insights to support business decision-making.
- **Environmental Impact Assessment:** Measure the effectiveness of recycling operations in reducing environmental harm through increased proper dumping.
- **Non-Legal Cleaning Identification:** Develop methods to detect and report unauthorized grease trap cleanings to protect business interests and compliance standards.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Provide stakeholders with an intuitive interface to access predictive insights, trend analyses, and operational metrics in real-time.

## Constraints & Assumptions
- **Data Availability:** The solution assumes access to clean, comprehensive historical plant data spanning 15+ years and availability of relevant external data sources.
- **Technology Integration:** The system must integrate seamlessly with existing operational workflows and data systems.
- **Budget and Timeline:** Development and implementation will adhere to allocated budget and timeline constraints defined by Envirol.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** The system must comply with environmental and data privacy regulations relevant to grease trap waste management.
- **Scalability:** The solution should be scalable to accommodate growing data volumes and expanding operational scope.

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in the number of missed grease trap cleanings by a targeted percentage within the first 6 months.
- Improvement in scheduling efficiency measured by reduced inspector idle time and optimized route coverage.
- Accuracy of market size and grease volume predictions within an acceptable error margin (e.g., Â±10%).
- Number of detected and reported illegal dumping incidents leading to enforcement actions.
- Positive stakeholder feedback on dashboard usability and insight relevance.
- Demonstrable reduction in environmental impact as measured by increased proper grease waste disposal rates.
- Increased revenue stability and growth linked to improved operational insights and forecasting.
